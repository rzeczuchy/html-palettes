      <p>I really like named HTML colors.</p>
      <p>
        Using human-readable color names makes your code more friendly
        and easier to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many developers and designers prefer using hex codes, since the list of
        available HTML colors is limited. However, limitation breeds creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I create these palettes to explore characteristics of HTML colors and
        their relationship in terms of brightness, saturation and hue.
      </p>
      <p>Feel free to use any of these for your projects.</p>
